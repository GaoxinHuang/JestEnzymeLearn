L12	Types of Tests
一.	概念
1.	Unit Test - Tests one piece (usually one function)
2.	Integration Tests - How multiple units work together 
3.	Acceptance / End-to-End (E2E) tests - How a user would interact with the app (selenium test)

L13	Test Behavior, not implementation
一.	概念
1.	Refactors should not affect tests
2.	Feature to Test 
	(1)	App keeps counter of button click count 
	(2)	Click count is stored in component state

3.	Good Test
	(1)	Set initial state
	(2)	Simulate clicking a button that increments counter
	(3)	Check to see if counter state was incremented
	
4.	Brittle test (bad test)
	(1)	Set initial state
	(2)	Simulate clicking a button that increments counter
	(3)	Check to see if particular function was called
	
5.	Why	Brittle
	(1)	Testing implementation (function name changed?)
	(2)	Not behvior (state update)
	
6.	Could extend this further
	(1)	Isn't state an implementation?
	(2)	Actual spec calls for counter display
	(3)	Sometimes skip unit test/work, focus on integration 

	
L14	Snapshot testing
一.	功能 snapshot (Jest feature)
1.	A way to "freeze" a component
2.	Test fails if there are any changes 

二.	No Snapshots here
1.	why:
(1).	No TDD
(2).	Brittle (any change to component might break snapshot)
(3).	No Test intent
(4).	If used, it's alongside traditional tests
